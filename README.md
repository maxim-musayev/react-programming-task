# react-programming-task

Welcome to the test, purpose of this exercise is to see your coding style and overall approach to software engineering and planning. In order to start the test please fork this repo, choose tasks to complete and once you are done send pull request.

### Project overview

The project is a simple web app should allow user to login/logout and was created using Next.js (+TypeScript).
Once logged in, the user can see random name and a few widgets. The user's name is fetched from the https://randomuser.me/api/ API. The widgets are just placeholders for now.

  - [] Horizontal and Vertical space between content widgets should be 32px
  - [] Widgets inner space should be 24px
  - [] Vertical space from page title to the first widget should be 48px and 64px from the top of the page

  - [] Refactor HTML/CSS code

- Functionality:

  - [] Each 10 sec fetch another user and update the state so that we see new name appears on the page

#### Additional Notes

- In the code you'll see several TODOs which should be removed once addressed
- Feel free to refactor existing code as you see fit
- You're not required to complete all the tasks (hovewer, no one will hold back your desire ðŸ˜Ž)
- Once you reach certain point of satisfaction, please write short estimation for the remaining tasks somewhere below

Good Luck!
